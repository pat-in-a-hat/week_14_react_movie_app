# React Movie App

## Overview
A react web application that displays a handful of of 80s and 90s movies and gives users the option to leave a review rating. Created as my Montana Code School Week 14 assignment, it utilizes local arrays for storage and react bootstrap for styling. This was done to save time and allow me to focus on other key concepts, such as making sure my basic UX/UI and state handling were being done properly. 

:clapper: Users can scroll through the movies and leave a review under each movie. A review modal pops up, with reviews appearing after the user hits save on the modal. 

:clapper: Images were grabbed from a movie poster sight, while movie information was sourced from IMDB. Image links can be found in the source code. 


## Upcoming changes
:hammer_and_wrench: Eventually planning on connecting this to the IMDB API

:hammer_and_wrench: Building out a navigation feature with pagination for controlled movie loading

:hammer_and_wrench: Need to clean up the bootstrap card UI so that they better adapt to different screen types.
